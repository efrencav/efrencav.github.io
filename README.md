# My website portfolio and resume page

This website was put together using a basic HTML5 template that uses Bootstrap and some custom Javascript.
The page was developed to showcase the work I put together while attending the Coding Bootcamp and also
to showcase my exisiting print portfolio from my career as a Graphic Designer.
